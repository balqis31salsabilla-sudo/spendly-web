# Spendly – Single-File Website

This folder contains `index.html` that you can deploy anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

Quick tips:
- **GitHub Pages**: create a repo, upload `index.html`, then enable Pages (branch: main, folder: root).
- **Netlify**: drag & drop the folder on app.netlify.com/drop or `netlify deploy` (ensure `index.html` at root).
- **Vercel**: `Import Project` → `Other` → upload the folder; framework: `Other` (static).
